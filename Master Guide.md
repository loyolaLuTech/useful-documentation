###Master Guide for Civilized Slacking.
_LuTech is a community of likeminded individuals. We have different skill-sets, beliefs, cultures. These are what make us great. Please, read the following guidelines. Hopefully they will be enough to encourage positive communication between our members and create a safe and creative environment for everyone._- LuTech Administration

* As part of providing a safe environment. We encourage the following:
	*  _Respect._ Race, Sexuality (or lack thereof), Culture, are not topics of contention. They can be topics of conversation, but never in a derogatory light. _We **love** our differences. They make us better. We want to encourage these differences, not discourage them._
	* See addendum 1.
* As part of facilitating communication. We request the following:
	* Use your real name! This will save much confusion.
	* Do not use mass tags such as **@channel** in public containers without obtaining permission from the leadership. We want to keep notifications relevant and low.
	* Do not use keywords. These are reserved for the administration, when we need to address everyone. These include:
		* **BLASTOFF** (for actionable items and miscellaneous)
		* **GENERALANNOUNCEMENT** (for announcements)
		* **SNAPSSNAPS** (for noteworthy achievements)
	* Keep personal conversations to private messages. If you need a channel, ask us to make one for you. 
	* We encourage everyone (thats you!) to set your notification settings to direct messages and keywords. This allows us to reach you better.

####Addendums

1. The above rules and guidelines are not suggestions. To keep everyone accountable, we have a simple two strike policy. Strikes fall off (stop counting) after a month.
	1. One strike, and you will be notified via private message on Slack.
	2. Two strike, and you will be removed from Slack for one month.
	3. If we have to remove you from slack more than once in a semester, you will regrettably not be welcome back at LuTech.
2. Type man slack in a channel to learn more about the usage of slack! and our cool special text.
